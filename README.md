<h3>Overview:</h3>
Our project is based upon disaster management in case of situations like flood and drought. Sinceit has been very frequently hitting our country and has had an adverse effect on the society. Be it social, economic or financial aspect, climate change always has a drastic effect. As we can see that climate change is for real, we need to assure that we are ready for it.

<h3>Problem Description:</h3>
We have taken hypothetical data of a state including the data of each city and its locality. The data contains information like the state/city/locality ID, population and altitude. We have tried to create a program to help reduce the effects of the calamities and make sure that there is very less damage done. We also have a functionality to file a missing person report in case of flood when a person goes missing.

<h3>Dataset:</h3>
There are 3 data files in total.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>
  <b>data.txt:</b>
  This file includes the details of state its cities and its localities. For our Project we have assumed that the total number of states to be 1 and the no.of cities in that state to be 15 and no.of localities in any city to be 30.
  Each State has its name and a state id, every state has 15 cities which has its name and city id, every city has 30 more loclaities which has locality name, locality id, locality house count, locality population count, locality altitude and each locality also has a water tank of depth 30ft.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>path.txt:</b><br>
      This data file has all the information about which two localities is connected by a path in a state and what is the distance of that path.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>waternetwork.txt:</b><br>
      This data file has the information about the water supply channel among the different cities and also the distance of the supply channel between each pair of city.
    </li>
  </ul>
